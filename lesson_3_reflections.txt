When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Typically when more than i person is working on the project and for backup/security purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You may not want to include other peoples changes at this point in development, may be unhelpful
