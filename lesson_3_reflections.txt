When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Typically when more than i person is working on the project and for backup/security purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You may not want to include other peoples changes at this point in development, may be unhelpful

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks - to effectively clone an existing repository on github
	clone - to copy an existing repository locally (can be on github)
	branches - when you want to work on a separate code version for a specific purpose

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Review other changes and decide what you may want to merge into your own branch / test
